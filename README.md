# Portuguese conjugation
While learning portuguese conjugation, I remarked there is some logic in it (ie, imperative uses indicative or subjunctive form depending on the person, etc.). So i thought that implementing the logic in code would assist me in understanding and remembering it.
That would also be a good way to learn about Python object inheritance.
# Use
Instantiate a tense class (ie "Presente_Indicativo"), set its verb and call conjugTudo() method.
# LIMITATIONS
The code implements some known irregular forms i studied or read in books, but will apply default forms to any verb it doesn't know.
It is not meant as a strong reference, but as a learning tool.
I tested it against my textbooks, but feel free to enrich it if you are seeing some errors.
